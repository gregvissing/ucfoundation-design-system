# Accordions

Arrow icon placed to the left of button text

See the <a href="https://github.com/scottaohara/accessible_accordions">source code for this demo on GitHub</a>

The following accordion examples are enhanced from a basic HTML pattern of container > heading + sub-container.

So without JavaScript, they will retain an appropriate document structure and the content will be completely accessible.
